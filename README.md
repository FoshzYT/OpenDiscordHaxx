# About
OpenDiscordHaxx is an opensource version of my raidbot 'DiscordHaxx' that was released about half a year ago.<br>
The idea of it is that you'll have a c# backend running in the background while being able to use a web interface UI, which interacts with the backend.<br><br>

Please note that this system is completely new and you might encounter bugs (if you do make sure to make an issue on github), and that this README is still under development.
